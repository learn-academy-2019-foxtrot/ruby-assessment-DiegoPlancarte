# ASSESSMENT 4: INTRO TO RUBY
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own there is always something more to learn.   

1. In what ways are JavaScript and Ruby similar? In what ways are they different?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
  JavaScript can be used as front-end and back-end language using the same language whereas Ruby is used as back-end programming language.
  JavaScript is an object-oriented scripting language that allows you to create dynamic HTML pages with interactive effects within a webpage. JavaScript allows you to process and maintain data within the browser. 
  It runs on web-browser only and it is an interpreted programming language. Ruby is an open-source programming language, object-oriented language with a focus on simplicity, portability, extensibility, and productivity.

2. What is a hash?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
  A hash is a function that converts one value to another.


3. What is the testing framework used in Ruby? Describe the process of setting up the testing environment.

  Your answer: 
  Rspec
  Similar to JavaScript testing, in Ruby you also write your test before writing the code for it. You then run your test file to ensure your test is working properly and fails because of the missing method and not because of an error in the test.

  Researched answer:
  RSpec is a unit test framework for the Ruby programming language.
  

4. Name three possible relationships between objects?

  Your answer:
  1) is a
  2) belongs to
  3) has many

  Researched answer:
  1) is a
  2) belongs to

5. What is an instance variable? How is it different from other variables in Ruby?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
  In the Ruby programming language, an instance variable is a type of variable which starts with an @ symbol.
  An instance variable is used as part of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to give objects their own private space to store data.


6. Ruby has a great community and tons of free resources to help you learn. [Here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/)is a list of great resources. Below are a few popular ones:
- [Interactive Ruby Tutorial](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)
- [Why's (poigniant) Guide to Ruby](http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-1.html): comics, anecdotes, and microscopic canaries
- [Ruby in 20 Min](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)
- [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/)

Choose one of these resources and look through the material for 10-15 min. List three new things you learned about Ruby:

1) Unused variables should have an underscore prefix(_)

2) Avoid methods longer than 10 LOC (lines of code). Ideally, most methods will be shorter than 5 LOC.

3) Use one expression per branch in a ternary operator. 
   This also means that ternary operators must not be nested. Prefer if/else constructs in these cases.
